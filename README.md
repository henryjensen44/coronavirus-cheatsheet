## Explaining Coronavirus

Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) is an infectious disease caused by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus, a virus closely related to the SARS virus. The disease first emerged in Wuhan, China and was named during the 2019â€“20 coronavirus outbreak. Those affected may develop a fever, dry cough, fatigue, and shortness of breath. A sore throat, runny nose or sneezing is less common.  While the majority of cases result in mild symptoms, some can progress to pneumonia and multi-organ failure. The case fatality rate is estimated at between 1% and 5%. - [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coronavirus_disease_2019)
